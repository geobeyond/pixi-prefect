# Prefect service user configuration
# These variables control which user runs Prefect services and where data is stored.
#
# By default:
# - prefect_user: defaults to ansible_user (the SSH user)
# - prefect_home: defaults to /opt/prefect
#
# To override, set these in your inventory.yml under all.vars:
#   prefect_service_user: "prefect-svc"
#   prefect_service_home: "/data/prefect"

prefect_user: "{{ prefect_service_user | default(ansible_user) }}"
prefect_home: "{{ prefect_service_home | default('/opt/prefect') }}"
